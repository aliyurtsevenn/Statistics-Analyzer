# Statistics-Analyzer
This program gets the input as an excell file and does the statistical analysis of the data.  

Both python code and parameters.txt files should be in the same directory. Otherwise, the code doesn't work. In the parameters.txt, you should type the required parameters accordingly. 

I would be very glad if you have any contributions for improving this program especially in multiple comprasion tests.
